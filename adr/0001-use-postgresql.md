# ADR 0001: Decide Technology Stack

## Status
Proposed

## Context
- The app needs a scalable and secure backend for handling travel bookings.
- We need a robust, cloud-native solution.
  
## Decision
We decided to go with **Node.js** for the backend due to:
- Scalability with async operations.
- Good support for APIs and microservices.
- Wide range of available libraries.

For the front end, we will use **React** because of:
- Component-based architecture.
- Ease of integration with the backend.
- Large community support.

## Consequences
- **Node.js** and **React** will allow for a faster development cycle.
- There might be a learning curve for some team members with Node.js.
